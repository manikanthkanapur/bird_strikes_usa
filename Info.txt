About

This project contains bird strikes data of the USA between 2000-2011. The dataset contains various parameters which include; altitude, sky conditions, no. of people injured, origin state of the flight, flight type, etc. The original dataset was taken from data.world

Data cleaning

The dataset was already clean and ready to be visualized to get important insights using Tableau Public.

Data visualization

The first step was to investigate into the trend of bird strikes over time. It was observed that the average bird strikes followed an increamental trend. This was an interesting observation. and to explore into this,  a hypothesis was made:

Bird strikes increased over time maybe beacuse of lack of warning given to the pilots. However, this was not the case as it didn't make any difference, i.e, even after impovement in the warnings over the years, the birds strikes are still rising. However one important observation made was that the early warnings reduced the injuries to the passengers on board. 

It was identified that the coastal areas experienced higher bird strike rates, and most of the incidents occurred at altitudes below 10,000 feet in cloudy conditions.
